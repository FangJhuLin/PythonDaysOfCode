#Day 6: Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.

while True:
#input introduction:
    string = input('please input something, could be anything:')
    x = input('tell me the character you want to count:')
    
    # check if it does input something, not null
    if bool(string) == 1 and bool(x)==1:
        string_count = string.count(x)
        print(f'I found {string_count} {x}!')
      
        
    else:
        print('you did not input anything, try again.')
