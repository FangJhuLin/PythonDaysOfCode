#Day 4: Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a list.

#enter a list, and split by space
list = input('Please enter the numbers of the list separated by a space: ').split()

# check if it does input a list, not null
if not list:
    print('The list has invalid values. Please enter the numbers of the list separated by a space:')
else:
    try:
        list = [float(x) for i, x in enumerate(list)]
        print(f'The sum of all elements is {sum(list)}')
    except:
        print('The list has invalid values')
